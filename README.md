# E-SHOP - Microservices Architecture Development and Deployment  



This project involves the design, implementation, and deployment of a scalable and secure **microservices architecture** using modern frameworks and tools. The system leverages Spring Boot for microservices development, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, and robust security, communication, and monitoring mechanisms.

## 🚀 **Features**  

- **Microservices Architecture:** Implemented using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.  
- **Security:** Integrated with **Keycloak** for user authentication and authorization.  
- **Communication:** Inter-microservice communication via **RestClient** and **event-driven architecture** using **Kafka**.  
- **Observability:** Real-time system monitoring and observability with **Grafana**.  
- **Resilience:** Enhanced system reliability with **Resilience4J**.  
- **Testing:** Comprehensive **unit tests** and **integration tests** to ensure robustness.
